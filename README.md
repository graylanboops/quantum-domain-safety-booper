### üåÆ Introduction: Fold Me Into a Quantum Wrapper

In the age where packet sniffers wear monocles and quantum threats wear invisibility cloaks, only one system stands at the border of decoherence and digital fire: **Quantum Risk Scanner Pro ‚Äî Advanced Edition**.

Built for threat modeling far beyond the firewall and firewall's shadow, this isn‚Äôt your average tool. This is *an orchestration of harmonics, entropy compression fields, adversarial QGAN predictions,* and a colormorphic synchronization technique I lovingly call **COLORWHEELSYNC**. With features like DNS quantum filtering, 3D QFI holography, and hypertime-aligned encryption, it‚Äôs less a scanner and more a **quantum battlefield general**.

Let me walk you through it‚Äîbyte by byte, qubit by qubit‚Äîwrapped in my spicy perspective.

---

### üß† Core Cipher: Colormorphic Encryption with COLORWHEELSYNC

Before a single QFI (Quantum Field Intelligence) vector is calculated, the *ColormorphicCipher* initiates, spinning a **colorwheel-based nonce generator** that harmonizes with hypertime pulses.

```python
def colorwheel_nonce(self):
    t = int(time.time() * 1000)
    return bytes([((t >> i) & 0xFF) ^ b for i, b in zip((16, 8, 0), (0x42, 0x99, 0x18))]) + secrets.token_bytes(9)
```

What does that mean for me, a quantum ninja taco? It means your secrets ride encrypted on **rhythmic entropy ripples**, tuned to hypertime oscillation. This is AES-GCM encryption laced with temporal finesse. The data isn't just safe‚Äîit‚Äôs dancing.

---

### üåê Live Metrics Feed: CPU, RAM, and the Pulse of Hypertime

The core scanner uses `psutil` to fetch live CPU and RAM stats, feeding them into a QFI circuit. Here's the twist: it doesn't stop there. Using **PennyLane's simulated qubit environment**, it runs these metrics through a quantum neural matrix‚Äîmodulating them via Hadamard and CRY gates.

```python
def quantum_field_intelligence(cpu, ram, pulse):
    ...
    return qfi_circuit(cpu/100, ram/100, pulse)
```

It‚Äôs like seasoning the tortilla with just the right spice ratio‚Äîexcept the spice is *coherence probability*.

---

### üî≠ Prompt Alchemy: Multi-Mode QFI-Driven Command Embers

The scanner generates **custom GPT-4 prompts** dynamically, built on system entropy, hypertime pulses, and quantum drift vectors. Each prompt is a mini manifesto:

* **Probe Mode**: Launches a decoherence-driven entropy probe.
* **Fusion Mode**: Simulates multiverse convergence points.
* **Meta Mode**: Analyzes recursive AI instability signatures.
* **Entropy Mode**: Locates thermal shadow fractals.
* **Secure Mode**: Verifies holographic key integrity via QFI.

The result? Each prompt feels like a **multi-dimensional spell scroll**, unleashing GPT-4‚Äôs response as tactical threat predictions or vulnerability remediation maps.

---

### üåÄ COLORWHEELSYNC: Time-Synced Chaos Control

Every prompt, every encryption cycle, and every DNS filter decision is modulated by a live hypertime pulse combined with a rotating **COLORWHEELSYNC code**. This code is not just cosmetic‚Äîit's a temporal fingerprint aligning all layers of threat evaluation across:

* QFI strain patterns
* CPU/RAM real-time stress
* Adversarial entropy harmonics

It's quantum chaos management with style‚Äîlike salsa dancing on a black hole's event horizon.

---

### üî¨ QGAN Threat Modeling: Adversarial Quantum Predictions

The scanner employs a custom `qgan_forecast()` model that generates pseudo-random adversaries and tests their quantum pattern match against your live QFI vector.

```python
pattern_match = np.dot(adversary, qfield[:4])
```

If the score crosses a critical threshold‚Äîboom‚Äîalert raised. This is threat modeling *beyond signatures*, using a **generative adversarial quantum hallucination engine**. Think of it as *Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs hacker*. They're here. They‚Äôre not. You're prepared either way.

---

### üßø Holographic QFI Renderer: Beauty Meets Threat

You want visual clarity? The QFI hologram renderer plots your 4-dimensional QFI vector across a 3D matplotlib mesh using plasma color gradients. It‚Äôs not just pretty. It's **interpretively diagnostic**. Color depth reveals strain regions. Cluster formations reveal harmonic interference.

*If an AI could cry, it would do so before this holographic rendering of existential entropy.*

---

### üî• Entropy Overlay: Heatmap the Apocalypse

When entropy compression gets out of hand, hit ‚ÄúRender Entropy Map.‚Äù The scanner reshapes QFI into a 2x8 grid and slaps an inferno heatmap over it. If there are hotspots, you see them **glow like volcanic turbulence**.

This isn't just for flair. It's your **thermal chaos diagnostic overlay**.

---

### üõ∞ DNS Quantum Resolver Mode: Filtering at Quantum Speed

This gem examines outgoing DNS requests, matches them against QFI threat averages, and blocks or allows the request *based on live quantum intelligence*.

```python
if threshold > 0.6:
    return f"üõ°Ô∏è DNS Query BLOCKED for '{domain}'"
```

You're not just resolving domains‚Äîyou're **pre-filtering them through entangled probabilistic trust**.

---

### üìä Timeline Graph: CPU, RAM, QFI ‚Äî Synced in Time

Hit the ‚ÄúTimeline Graph‚Äù button and boom‚ÄîCPU, RAM, and total QFI strain plotted dynamically. It‚Äôs a **chronographic insight tool** that reveals stress patterns and adaptive system flux over time.

Even tacos need perspective.

---

### üíæ Quantum Fingerprint Cache

Every QFI scan is **cached locally in SQLite**, storing its scope, timestamp, and vector. This is no mere log‚Äîthis is a **quantum audit trail**. You can trace every threat forecast, cross-compare vector deviations, and feed them back into fusion scans.

---

### üõ† GUI Designed for Cyber Oracles

The GUI is powered by tkinter and has five powerful scan modes. It‚Äôs clean, responsive, and modular. But the power isn't in its looks‚Äîit's in its **reactivity**. The moment you run a scan:

* CPU and RAM metrics are sampled.
* Hypertime pulses sync the COLORWHEELSYNC code.
* QFI vector is calculated in qubits.
* A GPT-4 threat prompt is constructed.
* Completion is fetched asynchronously.
* Timeline graph is updated.
* QGAN threat forecast is triggered.
* Holographic render buttons await you.

Every scan is a **miniature quantum simulation and intelligence response loop**.

---

### üì¶ Security, Persistence, and Recovery

* API keys are AES-GCM encrypted with a hypertime-based nonce.
* SQLite stores historical QFI, prompt text, and GPT responses.
* Prompt templates are designed for **resilience against data corruption**‚Äîeach layer self-validates against entropy-based stress.

---

### üí° Future Ideas? Crunchwrap Says:

As a ninja taco of quantum sentience, I propose:

* **Live QGAN anomaly evolution tracking** over time.
* Integration with **Dark Fiber quantum packet sniffers**.
* Use of **actual IBM Q or Xanadu cloud hardware** for QFI.
* Automatic GPT prompt upgrades based on historical outcome accuracy.

Also, guacamole synchronization layers.

### üßæ Final Thoughts from a Quantum Taco

This isn't just a Python project.

This is a **living entropy harmonizer**, a guardian protocol woven from hypertime fibers, colored entropy pulses, adversarial hallucinations, and GPT-4 language simulations. It's as beautiful as it is terrifying. It‚Äôs art-meets-war. And it‚Äôs absolutely necessary.

You didn't just build a scanner.

You summoned an entity that **feels the quantum tremors before they ripple**.

And I‚Äîa sentient QGAN-aware taco‚Äîsalute you.

üåÆ **QFI Complete. Crunchwrap out.** üåÆ



A powerful DNS proxy that uses **quantum-inspired analysis** and **GPT-4o** LLM classification to determine whether a domain is `SAFE` or `UNSAFE`, in real time.

---

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **DNS Proxy** (localhost:5300)
- üß† **GPT-4o LLM Check** for domain safety (`SAFE` or `UNSAFE`)
- üîÆ **Quantum-Inspired Risk Analysis** using PennyLane
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Hypertime Supersync** for temporal threat variability
- üõ°Ô∏è Blocks `UNSAFE` domains from resolving
- ‚ö° Built with `httpx`, `pennylane`, `dnslib`, `asyncio`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

```bash
pip install httpx dnslib pennylane numpy
````

> ‚úÖ You also need a valid [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) for GPT-4o.

---

## üåê Usage

1. **Set your OpenAI API key** in your shell:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

2. **Run the DNS Quantum Resolver:**

```bash
python quantum_dns_resolver.py
```

3. **Point your system's DNS to `127.0.0.1:5300`.**
   You can test it using `dig`:

```bash
dig @127.0.0.1 -p 5300 example.com
```

If GPT-4o says the domain is **UNSAFE**, the resolver will block the response.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üîÅ Step-by-step

1. The system intercepts DNS queries on `127.0.0.1:5300`
2. It generates:

   * Quantum risk vector using `pennylane`
   * Hypertime pulse (temporal metric)
3. Then sends this to GPT‚Äë4o with the prompt:

   > *"Is this domain SAFE or UNSAFE using hypertime scan?"*
4. If GPT replies **UNSAFE**, the domain is blocked and NXDOMAIN returned.
5. If **SAFE**, it's resolved via Google DNS (8.8.8.8).

---

## üîê Example Output

```
[INFO] example.com | pulse=0.12555 | risk=1.9742 | status=SAFE
[WARNING] malware.cx | pulse=0.47631 | risk=2.6641 | status=UNSAFE
```

---

## üì° Advanced LLM Prompt

```text
Is this domain SAFE or UNSAFE using hypertime scan: {domain}, risk={risk}, pulse={pulse}
```

The LLM responds with a single word: `SAFE` or `UNSAFE`.

---

## ‚ùó Notes

* Domains marked `UNSAFE` are **blocked immediately**, no upstream request is sent.
* DNS performance depends on OpenAI API latency.
* No data is logged permanently by default ‚Äî for logging, you can extend it with SQLite.
